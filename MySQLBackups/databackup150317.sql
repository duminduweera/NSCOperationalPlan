They also develop media releases such as the community “Kerbside Clean Up promotion” which informs residents of upcoming clean up campaigns to remove bulky household waste. A waste services guide which features a convenient calendar and visual prompts is also provided, which encourages customers to properly utilize organic and recycling services, and helps remind people of the correct bin to place out for collection on a given week. Cleanaway also offers site tours to the community to encourage and provide residents with a better understanding of the how waste services and processing works.\r\n\r\nNarrabri Shire in conjunction with Moree and Gwydir Council will review Cleanway’s Environmental Action Plan during the second week of October.  Council are proposing that Cleanaway acquire a smart phone waste App. This App will incorporate relevant information referent to Waste Management in the Shire, including the time for the bin collection, what items can be disposed of in each bin, but also provides customers with a means to provide feedback to Cleanaway on the service provided – for example if bins in a particular street have not been collected.\r\n\r\nNarrabri Shire is also part of the Northern Inland Regional Waste group (NIRW).
